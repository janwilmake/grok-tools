# Social Datapod

You should own and be able to do anything with your data, not just the apps, ais, and algoritms of the profit-oriented companies that now gatewall it. The goal of social datapod is to assist in the transition to a user-centric datamodel advocated by the [SOLID Protocol of Tim Benners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web](https://solidproject.org).

Social datapod assists in the creation of your **personal online datastore for social data**, primarily focused around X data, for now, but we're open to contributors building out parallels of other social platforms.

Currently, this repo contains a variety of tools helping developers make X Data more useful and exploring new use-cases. Please note that tools in this repo are usually are built upon the [official X API](https://docs.x.com/x-api/introduction) as well as third party X APIs. For personal data this choice is justified because as the author of your own X posts, threads, and conversations, you have the right to be do anything you want with it. My goal is to make commercial applications for personal data secure, user-centric, and generally, easier.
