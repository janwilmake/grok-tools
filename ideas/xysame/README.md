‚ùå Product idea

- login with X to authorize posts and tweeting
- login with github and pick a repo or make repo `knowledge`
- get vscode-like experience
  - nav on the left (similar to uithub)
  - md editor in the middle (using monaco)
  - tweets on the right (using simple html embed)
- whenever you save a file it will be pushed to the github repo and relevant tweets are regenerated

üî• **Even better** would be the same but in the form of a vscode/cursor extension;

1. build text to relevant tweets API with very fast cache that provides tweet IDs.
2. no login required per se (files are available offline, saving is handled by editor, X content is made available through xymake)
3. it'd just be a sidepanel that appears for the open file that shows the tweet embeds
4. freemium; more searches after github oauth + sponsorship

It could also be connected with chat history if it's saved and you use chat in vscode. However, that isn't needed.
