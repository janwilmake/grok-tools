# Simple MCP for your own context

- Installation is MCP that has X OAuth
- Finds up to 100 historic posts of your username
- Upon one-time purchase ($99) it will index all of your history for private use
- Ability to purchase continuous updates for $20/month
- In settings, switch between public/private

Context I want for myself:

- all my posts and comments and the entire thread of these surrounding my comments/posts
- Insights on the people I interacted with most (we have this data, it's just a query)

How:

- https://uithub.com/janwilmake/universal-mcp-oauth/blob/main/simplerauth-client/README.md with x-oauth-provider for login
- https://github.com/janwilmake/with-mcp for mcp; tools:
  - `timeline({q})`
- Stripeflare for one-time purchase $99 to get user a balance

# TODO

## ADD TOOL FOR INTERACTIONS!

- âœ… Update MCP such that `?username` is `.well-known/mcp-config` (optional, defaults to logged in user)
- Add tool to get stats in markdown
- instruct it that, for 'who' queries, it should look up stats first and simply query top people that seem possible, and give actual links to X posts.
- Do 'who do I know that may be interested in my new MCP, and why?'
- Make a thread on this and tag them.
- Also make secret URL available returning JSON[] of your interactons (for Parallel)

## Parallel for Headhunting

https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/parallel - do a thread on this! perfect for startup founders to find people they already know that might be looking for work. need to use my network and the interactions to determine whether or not they have

Use Parallel Task Group MCP with the Grokthsyelf MCP enabled on every task, with a starting URL being the key info I have about these interactions.

This needs the ability to oauth other MCP servers by calling the tool.

## Try Scoble: How do I create a viral post just from some examples for him?

- ðŸŸ  Sync Scobleizer 100k posts
- Quote https://x.com/Scobleizer/status/1975102387758285091 and make a thread "I built an MCP that knows Scobleizer and his network perfectly" with examples

https://letmeprompt.com/rules-httpsuithu-aazo5hr9df5s9k

## Bug DO spawns

`GET https://grokthyself.com//sito/wp-includes/wlwmanifest.xml - Ok @ 10/6/2025, 5:13:49 PM (log) Posts search request: q="", maxTokens=10000`

It is getting lots of these requests, they should hit 404! must be just 1 segment and that must be a DO with user with a row.

## Interaction Analysis

What's the most valuable? I guess a full context over my top N people is super valuable!!!!! Imagine a chat with janwilmake that knows his top 50 interactions very well, allowing it to use tool of another person context! Also, entities are super important for further deepening context. This is what will make it really stand out.

Core feature:

- After initial sync is complete (only for premium), for your top 150, do one LLM query per interaction, extracting `{ x_usernames:{[key:string]:string}, companies:{[key:string]:string}, websites:{[key:string]:string}, search_keywords:string[], interaction_summary:string,...}` and store `ai_analysis_interaction_count`.
- Redo it every week for accounts where more than 10 new interactions took place.
- Charge for LLM cost.
- Create `interactions_analysis:{summary:string,beliefs,principles,values}` which does an LLM prompt max once a month over all your interactions
- Add `interactions` JSON[] and `interactions_summary` into `users` as new columns
- Add interaction analysis into stats page
- Add structured data for this
- Add this as main MCP system prompt
- Create aggregate DO with just the users table (also has interactions)

See https://letmeprompt.com/httpsmarkdownfeed-xcibrc0

Doing weekly LLM-based named entity recognition on the last tokens in your timeline can be **incredibly powerful**! Imagine you could scope this for any person as a one-time scope or continuous scope, as long as they give access... This definitely is a product in itself that can make money. Should charge X price for its information...

It's perfect to then combine this with the task API: you login with X, then have a bunch of named entities as starting inputs for your APIs.

All in all, this could just be a tiny service:

- login with markdownfeed that has X money
- purchase feed for n weeks, and with that, accept terms (uses markdownfeed api)
- use api for letmeprompt + markdownfeed. generated result will become available as codeblock in a completion result at a fixed url
- provide this as oauth provider

Now, I can make the following for parallel

- Login with X
- Do one-time named entity recognition
- Any examples in the playground use these named entities

## Bug quoted posts

It should show the quoted thing too!!! context should be available in result already. Just simply make it part of the text in this case.

## Better landingpage

- âœ… install myself as mcp
- Search without query surfaces old posts somehow. figure out: why?
- Work on good examples by using it
- Improve landingpage by showing cost similar to how

## Installation directly from landingpage

- add `/login` in front in oauth flow
- One-click installation for cursor, vscode
- Instructions for others
- First tool-call should start sync and respond with 'still syncing'
- First purchase decision should happen asap
- First wow-moment too
- Link to pricing should log you in and redirect back to pricing

## Minibenchmark

Simple benchmark: ask questions about your friends people were asking grok a while ago for fun. vibe benchmark grok vs. grokthyself. put on landing.

## Ship well-converting landingpage

- Free trial
- Then early bird price $29
- Price increases to $59 within a week
- Price finally becomes $129
