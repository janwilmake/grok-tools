Doing weekly LLM-based named entity recognition on the last tokens in your timeline can be **incredibly powerful**! Imagine you could scope this for any person as a one-time scope or continuous scope, as long as they give access... This definitely is a product in itself that can make money. Should charge X price for its information...

It's perfect to then combine this with the task API: you login with X, then have a bunch of named entities as starting inputs for your APIs.

All in all, this could just be a tiny service:

- login with markdownfeed that has X money
- purchase feed for n weeks, and with that, accept terms (uses markdownfeed api)
- use api for letmeprompt + markdownfeed. generated result will become available as codeblock in a completion result at a fixed url
- provide this as oauth provider

Now, I can make the following for parallel

- Login with X
- Do one-time named entity recognition
- Any examples in the playground use these named entities
